# qb-itemstorage. Items with Storage!
This resource says what it does on the box, Items with their own storage.

If you want a backpack that you can store items in, this can do it.

If you want a pizza box to put pizza into, this can do it.

If you want a cigarette box with cigarettes already in the pouch, this can do it.

If you want me to give you $100, you are in the wrong place.

## Dependencies
- [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
- [qb-inventory](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-inventory) - Also works on other mixes like aj-inventory

## Features
- Add items with storage
- Can set slots an weight
- Can set default items for the storage item

## Installation
### Manual
- Download the script, rename it to `qb-itemstorage` and put it in the `[qb]` directory.
- set config options to create your item
- add item to shared items.lua file
- Start the server

## Shared items.lua
Be sure to use the following as a template in your shared items.lua file under the qb-core folder.
You will need to create each item in your shared items.lua file before it can be used in the config.

```lua
['cigarettebox'] 				 = {['name'] = 'cigarettebox', 			  	  	['label'] = 'Cigarette Box', 			['weight'] = 13, 		['type'] = 'item', 		['image'] = '69-brand-pack.png', 		['unique'] = true, 		['useable'] = true, 	['shouldClose'] = true,    ['combinable'] = nil,   ['description'] = 'A cigarette box for holding cigarettes'},
```

## tnj-inventory setup
If you are using tnj-inventory, you need to add a decay and created value in your qb-core/shared/items for all items, the decay is set to be the days the item lasts
```lua
["created"] = nil
["decay"] = 28.0 -- for 28 days
```

You will also need to add the following into the itemstorage config.lua file for each item you are adding by default. 
This line can go in under "useable = true" for each item.
```lua
quality = 100
```
